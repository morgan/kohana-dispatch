# Dataflow

By default, JSON and PHP response types are supported. Optional support of 
[Dataflow](https://github.com/morgan/kohana-dataflow) module for expanded response parsing 
(XML, YAML, JSON, JSON-P, PHP). Setup is as simple as adding Dataflow to your application 
bootstrap, no configuration required as response type is automatically detected.
